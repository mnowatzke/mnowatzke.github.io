I do data science and modelling for sustainable/regenerative agriculture. I'm also trained in human-computer interaction/user research. I like to dabble in game development, watercolors, am an avid reader, gardener, and outdoor enthusiast.

If you'd like to learn more about my work or discuss opportunities, feel free to contact me at mattnowatz@gmail.com or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattnowatzke/).
