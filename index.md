My research combines the quantitative and qualitative, leveraging user research and data science. I incorporate cross-functional user research methods to ensure that software, tools, etc. are useful and usable for intended audiences. I also have experience using geospatial remote sensing, machine learning, and many associated libraries and tools (e.g., rasterio, GeoPandas, gdal, ogr2ogr, PostGIS, etc.).
