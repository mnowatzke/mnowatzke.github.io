<<<<<<< HEAD
I do data science and modelling for sustainable/regenerative agriculture. I'm also trained in human-computer interaction/user research and like to dabble in game development, watercolors, am an avid reader, gardener, outdoor enthusiast, and father + husband.
=======
My research combines the quantitative and qualitative, leveraging user research and data science. I incorporate cross-functional user research methods to ensure that software, tools, etc. are useful and usable for intended audiences. I also have experience using geospatial remote sensing, machine learning, and many associated libraries and tools (e.g., rasterio, GeoPandas, gdal, ogr2ogr, PostGIS, etc.).
