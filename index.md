My work combines the quantitative and qualitative with a PhD in Agronomy & Environmental Science and an MS in Human-Computer Interaction. I leverage remote sensing data sources and machine learning to analyze cropping systems for productivity and environmental impact. I also incorporate methods like interviews, usability studies, and affinity diagramming (to name a few) to ensure that data and tools are useful and usable for intended audiences.
