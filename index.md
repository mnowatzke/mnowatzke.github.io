I do data science and modelling for sustainable/regenerative agriculture. I'm also trained in human-computer interaction/user research and like to dabble in game development, watercolors, am an avid reader, gardener, outdoor enthusiast, and father + husband.

If you'd like to learn more about my work or discuss opportunities, feel free to contact me at mattnowatz@gmail.com or find me on LinkedIn.
