title: "The First Post"

Hello and welcome. If you're here, you probably know me or are looking for more information about me. My plan is for this blog to outline things I'm currently learning (I'm always trying to learn something new) and likely how I can apply it to agriculture. Possible topics may include crop physiology, data science and statistics, Python, and user research methods.

My goal for the first posts is to summarize some aspects of crop yield, likely from the excellent 'The Physiology of Crop Yield' book by Hay & Porter, in preparation for my defense. This will also give me a nice break from writing manuscripts and making figures.

There is no timeline for this, just when I have the time! Thanks for stopping by.

Matt
